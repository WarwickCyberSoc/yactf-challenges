Monero actually is what unsophisticated investors think they&rsquo;re investing in when they&rsquo;re investing in bitcoin.</p>
<p>Monero is the magic internet money that the government can&rsquo;t stop or control, a store of value that the cypherpunk founding fathers of cryptocurrency envisioned when they began working on bitcoin. And as we can be sure from the steady stream of &ldquo;bad press,&rdquo; Monero is what people trying to actually use cryptocurrency for actual use cases aside from speculation actually use.</p>
<p>A helpful parallel is the dot com bubble of the late nineties. In hindsight, all of the people who lost their shirts were correct that e-commerce would be the future of business. But they didn&rsquo;t know the which and the how. The companies which were the least interesting and captivating, the reliable little search engine, the trusty little bookstore, and others that actually delivered on real value eventually went over the moon.</p>
<p>MySpace had an indomitable first mover advantage and network effect right up until it didn&rsquo;t. And bitcoin&rsquo;s &ldquo;MySpace Moment&rdquo; is coming soon enough. Monero probably won&rsquo;t be centered in the early part of that story, and it&rsquo;s growth will likely be largely in stablecoin tokens of XMR locked up in whichever smart contract chain wins.</p>
<p>This is an interesting market within interesting times, and it&rsquo;s way too early to count Monero out.</p>
